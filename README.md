**We aim to fix email, come help us do it.**

We have just updated the ProtoBufs file that describes the protocol that we will be using. Note: This file will be in constant flux until we release later this year.

If you have a suggestion, please submit a pull-request. We will try to create a solution that brings together everyone's ideas.
